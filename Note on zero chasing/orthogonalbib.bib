Both these transformations are global iterative methods for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix, the matrix converging in general to triangular form. In Par t1 of this paper the QR transformation was briefly described and we were then principally concerned with proving convergence, the main result being expressed in theorem 3. We also showed that if the matrix is first reduced to almost triangular form important advantages are gained (further advantages will become apparent) and we gave in outline a way in which convergence could be improved. In this part of the paper we consider the practical application of the QR transformation. Two versions of the algorithm have been programmed for the Pegasus computer; these are described and an attempt is made to evaluate the method. Some results and detailed algorithms are given in appendices. Part 1 was published on pp. 265–71 of this volume (Oct. 61).}",

Unfortunately, the process computers redundant copies of the outermost eigenvectors and has to be used with some skill.

abstract = {The relatively robust representations (RRR) algorithm computes the eigendecomposition of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix T with an O(n2) complexity. This article discusses how this method can be extended to the bidiagonal SVD B=UΣVT. It turns out that using the RRR algorithm as a black box to compute BTB=VΣ2VT and BBT=UΣ2UT separately may give poor results for ∥BV−UΣ∥. The use of the standard Jordan–Wielandt representation can fail as well if clusters of tiny singular values are present. A solution is to work on BTB and to keep factorizations of BBT implicitly. We introduce a set of coupling transformations which allow us to replace the representation u=1σBv by a more stable representation u=Xv, where X is a diagonal matrix. Numerical results of our implementation are compared with the LAPACK routines DSTEGR, DBDSQR and DBDSDC.}

We present a new algorithm which computes all the singular values of a bidiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy independent of their magnitudes. In contrast, the standard algorithm for bidiagonal matrices may compute small singular values with no relative accuracy at all. Numerical experiments show that the new algorithm is comparable in speed to the standard algorithm, and frequently faster.

We revisit a previously rejected numerical approach in a new algorithm called ‘do-one-then-do-the-other’. One of two input matrices is diagonalized by a unitary similarity, and then the computed eigenvectors are applied to the other input matrix. Additional passes are applied as necessary to resolve invariant subspaces associated with repeated eigenvalues and eigenvalue clusters. The algorithm is derived by first developing a spectral divide-and-conquer method and then allowing the method to break the spectrum into, not just two invariant subspaces, but as many as safely possible. Most computational work is delegated to a black-box eigenvalue solver, which can be tailored to specific computer architectures. The overall running time is a small multiple of a single eigenvalue-eigenvector computation, even on difficult problems with tightly clustered eigenvalues. The article concludes with applications to a structured eigenvalue problem and a highly sensitive eigenvector computation.}",

abstract = {Abstract:
We develop a Jacobi-like scheme for computing the generalized Schur form of a regular pencil of matrices λ B – A. The method starts with a preliminary triangularization of the matrix B and iteratively reduces A to triangular form, while maintaining B triangular. The scheme heavily relies on the technique of Stewart for computing the Schur form of an arbitrary matrix A. Just as Stewart's algorithm, this one can efficiently be implemented in parallel on a square array of processors. This explains some of its peculiarities, and at the same time yields further insight in Stewart's algorithm.}

 abstract = {Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold and ν a probability measure on M. Assume 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. We derive a new bound (in terms of p, the injectivity radius of M and an upper bound on the sectional curvatures of M) on the radius of a ball containing the support of ν which ensures existence and uniqueness of the global Riemannian L p center of mass with respect to v. A significant consequence of our result is that under the best available existence and uniqueness conditions for the so-called "local" L p center of mass, the global and local centers coincide. In our derivation we also give an alternative proof for a uniqueness result by W. S. Kendall. As another contribution, we show that for a discrete probability measure on M, under the existence and uniqueness conditions, the (global) L p center of mass belongs to the closure of the convex hull of the masses. We also give a refined result when M is of constant curvature.},
